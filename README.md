1. Differences between Control Panel and CLI:
Control Panel is more visual and easier for beginners. CLI is faster once you're familiar.

2. Which method was more efficient and why?
CLI was more efficient because I could set everything with one command.

3. Why SSH key-based authentication is recommended:
Itâ€™s more secure and prevents password-based attacks.

4. What value do backups and monitoring add:
Backups protect my data; monitoring keeps me informed about server performance
